# discord-paladins

This a wrapper for the Paladins API by Hi-Rez studios.

## Getting Started

You can either copy the PHP file directly into your project or _preferable_ just use composer.

#### Composer require command
`composer require bennetgallein/paladins-php`

## Usage

It is fairly easy to use. I'll throw in an example.

```php
coming soon
```
